# Master's Thesis

This is a private repository I will use to write my Thesis on 
**Detecting Double-Talk (Overlapping Speech) in Conversations using Deep Learning**
in lieu of obtaining my Masters in Media Informatics from RWTH Aachen University,
and in completing my research project at Fraunhofer IAIS, Sankt Augustin.

This is just the beginning, so things will be changing as per need.

However, a rough plan for the content of this repository is as follows:

- One giant `thesis.org` file with everything, including:
	+ The thesis itself, as a top level heading.
	+ Any outlining and plannings.
	+ Worklflows, and supporting references, mostly related to the *writing* process.
	+ Loggings, with journal type entries and tasks.
- A bunch of folders with/and supporting files, like images, scripts, LaTeX classes, bib, etc.
- Probably, a Makefile to rule them all.

Best Wishes!
