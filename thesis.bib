  abstract = {The performance of modern large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems is heavily affected by segment boundaries, proper speaker identification of the segments, as well as removal of spurious data. We propose to use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks to partition audio into speech segments as well as track speaker turns. Additionally, we train an LSTM to also identify music segments. We show that the accurate detection of events, along with removal of silence and music, using our LSTM yields a 9-10\% relative improvement in ASR performance. Secondary processing by speaker clustering provides an additional boost in accuracy. Event detection accuracy of the LSTM approach is also described.},

  doi = {10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178867},
  abstract = {The ability to estimate the number of words spoken by an individual over a certain period of time is valuable in second language acquisition, healthcare, and assessing language development. However, establishing a robust automatic framework to achieve high accuracy is non-trivial in realistic/naturalistic scenarios due to various factors such as different styles of conversation or types of noise that appear in audio recordings, especially in multi-party conversations. In this study, we propose a noise robust overlapped speech detection algorithm to estimate the likelihood of overlapping speech in a given audio file in the presence of environment noise. This information is embedded into a word-count estimator, which uses a linear minimum mean square estimator (LMMSE) to predict the number of words from the syllable rate. Syllables are detected using a modified version of the mrate algorithm. The proposed word-count estimator is tested on long duration files from the Prof-Life-Log corpus. Data is recorded using a LENA recording device, worn by a primary speaker in various environments and under different noise conditions. The overlap detection system significantly outperforms baseline performance in noisy conditions. Furthermore, applying overlap detection results to word-count estimation achieves 35\% relative improvement over our previous efforts, which included speech enhancement using spectral subtraction and silence removal.},

  abstract = {Recurrent sequence generators conditioned on input data through an attention mechanism have recently shown very good performance on a range of tasks in- cluding machine translation, handwriting synthesis and image caption gen- eration. We extend the attention-mechanism with features needed for speech recognition. We show that while an adaptation of the model used for machine translation in reaches a competitive 18.7\% phoneme error rate (PER) on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, it can only be applied to utterances which are roughly as long as the ones it was trained on. We offer a qualitative explanation of this failure and propose a novel and generic method of adding location-awareness to the attention mechanism to alleviate this issue. The new method yields a model that is robust to long inputs and achieves 18\% PER in single utterances and 20\% in 10-times longer (repeated) utterances. Finally, we propose a change to the at- tention mechanism that prevents it from concentrating too much on single frames, which further reduces PER to 17.6\% level.},

This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning, and deep networks.

In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units.

However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN.},

In this paper, we study the LSTM-RNN speaker-aware training that incorporates the speaker information during model training to normalise the speaker variability. We first present several speaker-aware training architectures, and then empirically evaluate three types of speaker representation: I-vectors, bottleneck speaker vectors and speaking rate. Furthermore, to factorize the variability in the acoustic signals caused by speakers and phonemes respectively, we investigate the speaker-aware and phone-aware joint training under the framework of multi-task learning. In AMI meeting speech transcription task, speaker-aware training of LSTM-RNNs reduces word error rates by 6.5\% relative to a very strong LSTM-RNN baseline, which uses FMLLR features.},

CNSC aims to decompose a composite signal into its underlying contributory parts and is thus naturally suited to overlap detection and attribution. Experimental results on NIST RT data show that the CNSC approach gives comparable results to a state-of-the-art hidden Markov model based overlap detector.

We show that frame stacking and reduced frame rate lead to more accurate models and faster decoding. CD phone modeling leads to further improvements. We also present initial results for LSTM RNN models outputting words directly.},

  abstract = {Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful model for sequential data. End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates deep recurrent neural networks, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7\% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score.},

For the high-quality signal case of a single mixed-headset channel signal, we demonstrate a relative improvement of about 7.4\% DER over the baseline diarization system, while for the more challenging case of the single far-field channel signal relative improvement is 3.6\%.

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional and pooling operations along the frequency axis have been proposed to attain invariance to frequency shifts of features. However, this is inappropriate with regard to the fact that acoustic features vary in frequency. In this paper, we contend that convolution along the time axis is more effective. We also propose the addition of an intermap pooling (IMP) layer to deep CNNs. In this layer, filters in each group extract common but spectrally variant features, then the layer pools the feature maps of each group. As a result, the proposed IMP CNN can achieve insensitivity to spectral variations characteristic of different speakers and utterances. The effectiveness of the IMP CNN architecture is demonstrated on several LVCSR tasks. Even without speaker adaptation techniques, the architecture achieved a WER of 12.7\% on the SWB part of the Hub5'2000 evaluation test set, which is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods.},

Recently, more direct end-to-end methods have been investigated, in which neural architectures were trained to model sequences of characters [1,2]. To our knowledge, all these approaches relied on Connectionist Temporal Classification [3] modules. We investigate an alternative method for sequence modelling based on an attention mechanism that allows a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to learn alignments between sequences of input frames and output labels. We show how this setup can be applied to LVCSR by integrating the decoding RNN with an n-gram language model and by speeding up its operation by constraining selections made by the attention mechanism and by reducing the source sequence lengths by pooling information over time. Recognition accuracies similar to other HMM-free RNN-based approaches are reported for the Wall Street Journal corpus.},

  doi = {10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306205},
  abstract = {Speaker diarization systems attempt to assign temporal speech segments in a conversation to the appropriate speaker, and non-speech segments to non-speech. Speaker diarization systems basically provide an answer to the question "Who spoke when ?". One inherent deficiency of most current systems is their inability to handle co-channel or overlapped speech. During the past few years, several studies have attempted dealing with the problem of overlapped or co-channel speech detection and separation, however, most of the algorithms suggested perform under unique conditions, require high computational complexity and require both time and frequency domain analysis of the audio data. In this study, frame based entropy analysis of the audio data in the time domain serves as a single feature for an overlapped speech detection algorithm. Identification of overlapped speech segments is performed using Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) along with well known classification algorithms applied on two speaker conversations. By employing this methodology, the proposed method eliminates the need for setting a hard threshold for each conversation or database. LDC CALLHOME American English corpus is used for evaluation of the suggested algorithm. The proposed method successfully detects 60.0\% of the frames labeled as overlapped speech by the baseline (ground-truth) segmentation , while keeping a 5\% false-alarm rate.},

  abstract = {The problem of detecting overlapped speech in stereo recordings using close-talk microphones is important for a variety of applications including the identification of back-channels, interruptions etc. in a dyadic or multi-party interactions. For detecting overlapped speech, we propose a feature derived using the spectral similarity of two channels over a range of acoustic frames. During overlapped speech frames the proposed spectro-temporal similarity-based feature values decrease and during non-overlapped speech frames the feature values increase due to the presence of cross-talk. Thus the proposed feature helps to discriminate the overlapped speech frames from the non-overlapped ones. Using overlapped speech detection experiments on a dyadic interaction corpus, it is shown that the proposed feature provides a significant improvement 26\% absolute, in the accuracy of detecting the overlapped speech frames when used as an additional feature to the baseline feature obtained from the two channels' intensity profiles.},

In this paper we investigate how to efficiently scale these models to larger datasets. Specifically, we address the design choice of pooling and padding along the time dimension which renders convolutional evaluation of sequences highly inefficient. We propose a new CNN design without timepadding and without timepooling, which is slightly suboptimal for accuracy, but has two significant advantages: it enables sequence training and deployment by allowing efficient convolutional evaluation of full utterances, and, it allows for batch normalization to be straightforwardly adopted to CNNs on sequence data. Through batch normalization, we recover the lost peformance from removing the time-pooling, while keeping the benefit of efficient convolutional evaluation. We demonstrate the performance of our models both on larger scale data than before, and after sequence training. Our very deep CNN model sequence trained on the 2000h switchboard dataset obtains 9.4 word error rate on the Hub5 test-set, matching with a single model the performance of the 2015 IBM system combination, which was the previous best published result.},

The design of the pooling layer is guided by domain knowledge about how speech classes would change when formant frequencies are modified. The convolution and heterogeneous-pooling layers are followed by a fully connected multi-layer neural network to form a deep architecture interfaced to an HMM for continuous speech recognition. During training, all layers of this entire deep net are regularized using a variant of the âdropoutâ technique. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of both heterogeneous pooling and dropout regularization. On the TIMIT phonetic recognition task, we have achieved an 18.7\% phone error rate, lowest on this standard task reported in the literature with a single system and with no use of information about speaker identity. Preliminary experiments on large vocabulary speech recognition in a voice search task also show error rate reduction using heterogeneous pooling in the deep convolutional neural network.},

In this work we use DBNs for audio-visual speech recognition; in particular, we use deep learning from audio and visual features for noise robust speech recognition. We test two methods for using DBNs in a multimodal setting: a conventional decision fusion method that combines scores from single-modality DBNs, and a novel feature fusion method that operates on mid-level features learned by the single-modality DBNs. On a continuously spoken digit recognition task, our experiments show that these methods can reduce word error rate by as much as 21\% relative over a baseline multi-stream audio-visual GMM/HMM system.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an alternative type of neural network that can be used to reduce spectral variations and model spectral correlations which exist in signals. Since speech signals exhibit both of these properties, CNNs are a more effective model for speech compared to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we explore applying CNNs to large vocabulary speech tasks. First, we determine the appropriate architecture to make CNNs effective compared to DNNs for LVCSR tasks. Specifically, we focus on how many convolutional layers are needed, what is the optimal number of hidden units, what is the best pooling strategy, and the best input feature type for CNNs. We then explore the behavior of neural network features extracted from CNNs on a variety of LVCSR tasks, comparing CNNs to DNNs and GMMs. We find that CNNs offer between a 13-30\% relative improvement over GMMs, and a 4-12\% relative improvement over DNNs, on a 400-hr Broadcast News and 300-hr Switchboard task.},

A large number of comparative studies have been conducted in attempts to establish the relative superiority of these methods. This paper argues that these comparisons often fail to take into account important aspects of real problems, so that the apparent superiority of more sophisticated methods may be something of an illusion. In particular, simple methods typically yield performance almost as good as more sophisticated methods, to the extent that the difference in performance may be swamped by other sources of uncertainty that generally are not considered in the classical supervised classification paradigm.},

The approaches detect speaker changes by recursively partitioning a large analysis window into two sub-windows and recursively verifying the merging of two adjacent audio segments using DeltaBIC, a widely-adopted distance measure of two audio segments. We compare our approaches to three popular distance-based approaches, namely, Chen and Gopalakrishnan's window-growing-based approach, Siegler et al.'s fixed-size sliding window approach, and Delacourt and Wellekens's DISTBIC approach, by performing computational cost analysis and conducting speaker change detection experiments on two broadcast news data sets. The results show that the proposed approaches are more efficient and achieve higher segmentation accuracy than the compared distance-based approaches. In addition, we apply the segmentation approaches discussed in this paper to the speaker diarization task. The experiment results show that a more effective segmentation approach leads to better diarization accuracy.},

Furthermore, we formulate a message passing inference scheme based on an approximate graph factorization, identify this inference scheme as a particular message passing schedule based on the turbo principle and suggest further alternative schedules. The experiments show an improved performance over speech presence probability estimation based on an IID assumption, and a slightly better performance of the turbo schedule over the alternatives.},

  abstract = {New waves of consumer-centric applications, such as voice search and voice interaction with mobile devices and home entertainment systems, increasingly require automatic speech recognition (ASR) to be robust to the full range of real-world noise and other acoustic distorting conditions. Despite its practical importance, however, the inherent links between and distinctions among the myriad of methods for noise-robust ASR have yet to be carefully studied in order to advance the field further. To this end, it is critical to establish a solid, consistent, and common mathematical foundation for noise-robust ASR, which is lacking at present. This article is intended to fill this gap and to provide a thorough overview of modern noise-robust techniques for ASR developed over the past 30 years. We emphasize methods that are proven to be successful and that are likely to sustain or expand their future applicability. We distill key insights from our comprehensive overview in this field and take a fresh look at a few old problems, which nevertheless are still highly relevant today. Specifically, we have analyzed and categorized a wide range of noise-robust techniques using five different criteria: 1) feature-domain vs. model-domain processing, 2) the use of prior knowledge about the acoustic environment distortion, 3) the use of explicit environment-distortion models, 4) deterministic vs. uncertainty processing, and 5) the use of acoustic models trained jointly with the same feature enhancement or model adaptation process used in the testing stage. With this taxonomy-oriented review, we equip the reader with the insight to choose among techniques and with the awareness of the performance-complexity tradeoffs. The pros and cons of using different noise-robust ASR techniques in practical application scenarios are provided as a guide to interested practitioners. The current challenges and future research directions in this field is also carefully analyzed.},

In our proposed method, we model the histogram of estimated directions of arrival with a non-parametric Bayesian infinite Gaussian mixture model. As an alternative to classical model selection criteria and to avoid specifying the maximum number of mixture components in advance, a Dirichlet process prior is employed over the mixture components. This allows to automatically determine the optimal number of mixture components that most probably model the observations. We demonstrate by experiments that this model outperforms a parametric approach using a finite Gaussian mixture model with a Dirichlet distribution prior over the mixture weights.},

  abstract = {This work is an extension of a previous work in which an automatic speech segmentation and labeling system was proposed based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) speech recognizer followed by a fuzzy-logic boundary correction system. In this paper we explore the possibility of substituting that difficult to design fuzzy-logic system by a neural network (NN) based system that can be automatically trained. First, the whole fuzzy-logic boundary correction system, which used different rule sets for each kind of phonetic transition, has been substituted by a single NN. Results show that this single NN outperforms the complete fuzzy-logic system. Then, the possibility of using different NNs specialized in each kind of phonetic transition has been explored. Results are again clearly better than the results obtained with the fuzzy-logic system, but not clearly better than the results obtained with just one NN},

  abstract = {This paper presents the results and conclusions of a thorough study on automatic phonetic segmentation. It starts with a review of the state of the art in this field. Then, it analyzes the most frequently used approach-based on a modified Hidden Markov Model (HMM) phonetic recognizer. For this approach, a statistical correction procedure is proposed to compensate for the systematic errors produced by context-dependent HMMs, and the use of speaker adaptation techniques is considered to increase segmentation precision. Finally, this paper explores the possibility of locally refining the boundaries obtained with the former techniques. A general framework is proposed for the local refinement of boundaries, and the performance of several pattern classification approaches (fuzzy logic, neural networks and Gaussian mixture models) is compared within this framework. The resulting phonetic segmentation scheme was able to increase the performance of a baseline HMM segmentation tool from 27.12\%, 79.27\%, and 97.75\% of automatic boundary marks with errors smaller than 5, 20, and 50 ms, respectively, to 65.86\%, 96.01\%, and 99.31\% in speaker-dependent mode, which is a reasonably good approximation to manual segmentation.},

  abstract = {Conversational speech recognition has served as a flagship speech recognition task since the release of the Switchboard corpus in the 1990s. In this paper, we measure the human error rate on the widely used NIST 2000 test set, and find that our latest automated system has reached human parity. The error rate of professional transcribers is 5.9\% for the Switchboard portion of the data, in which newly acquainted pairs of people discuss an assigned topic, and 11.3\% for the CallHome portion where friends and family members have open-ended conversations. In both cases, our automated system establishes a new state of the art, and edges past the human benchmark, achieving error rates of 5.8\% and 11.0\%, respectively. The key to our system's performance is the use of various convolutional and LSTM acoustic model architectures, combined with a novel spatial smoothing method and lattice-free MMI acoustic training, multiple recurrent neural network language modeling approaches, and a systematic use of system combination.},

In our study, we focus on call center data, with customers and operators engaged in problem-solving tasks. We propose and evaluate an annotation scheme for these two overlap categories in the context of spontaneous and in-vivo human conversations. We analyze the distinctive predictive characteristics of a very large set of high-dimensional acoustic feature.

  abstract = {Traditional speech/non-speech segmentation systems have been designed for specific acoustic conditions, such as broadcast news or meetings. However, little research has been done on consumer-produced audio. This type of media is constantly growing and has complex characteristics such as low quality recordings, environmental noise and overlapping sounds. This paper discusses an evaluation of three different approaches for speech/non-speech detection on consumer-produced audio. The approaches are state-of-the-art speech/non-speech detectors-one based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), another on Support Vector Machines (SVM), and the last on Neural Networks (NN). Using the TRECVID MED 2012 database, we designed training/testing sets combinations to aid the understanding of what speech/non-speech detection on consumer-produced media entails and how traditional approaches to this detection performed in this domain. The results revealed that the cross-domain state-of-the-art GMM and SVM systems' tests underperformed a one-layer NN algorithm, which had 20\% higher accuracy and computed audio 5 times faster.},

Distributions of pause, gap and overlap durations in conversations are presented, and methodological issues regarding the statistical treatment of such distributions are discussed. The results are related to published minimal response times for spoken utterances and thresholds for detection of acoustic silences in speech. It is shown that turn-taking is generally less precise than is often claimed by researchers in the field of conversation analysis or interactional linguistics. These results are discussed in the light of their implications for models of timing in turn-taking, and for interaction control models in speech technology. In particular, it is argued that the proportion of speaker changes that could potentially be triggered by information immediately preceding the speaker change is large enough for reactive interaction controls models to be viable in speech technology.},

  abstract = {The performance of present-day automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems is seriously compromised by levels of acoustic interference (such as additive noise and room reverberation) representative of real-world speaking conditions. Studies on the perception of speech by human listeners suggest that recognizer robustness might be improved by focusing on temporal structure in the speech signal that appears as low-frequency (below 16 Hz) amplitude modulations in subband channels following critical-band frequency analysis. A speech representation that emphasizes this temporal structure, the âmodulation spectrogramâ, has been developed. Visual displays of speech produced with the modulation spectrogram are relatively stable in the presence of high levels of background noise and reverberation. Using the modulation spectrogram as a front end for ASR provides a significant improvement in performance on highly reverberant speech. When the modulation spectrogram is used in combination with log-RASTA-PLP (log RelAtive SpecTrAl Perceptual Linear Predictive analysis) performance over a range of noisy and reverberant conditions is significantly improved, suggesting that the use of multiple representations is another promising method for improving the robustness of ASR systems.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has become increasingly popular in both academic and industrial areas in the past years. Various domains including pattern recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing have witnessed the great power of deep networks. However, current studies on deep learning mainly focus on data sets with balanced class labels, while its performance on imbalanced data is not well examined. Imbalanced data sets exist widely in real world and they have been providing great challenges for classification tasks. In this paper, we focus on the problem of classification using deep network on imbalanced data sets. Specifically, a novel loss function called mean false error together with its improved version mean squared false error are proposed for the training of deep networks on imbalanced data sets. The proposed method can effectively capture classification errors from both majority class and minority class equally. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared with conventional methods in classifying imbalanced data sets on deep neural networks.},

  abstract = {Overlapped speech is referred to a monophonic audio signal in which at least two speakers are present at the same time. In this study, the focus is on distinguishing overlapped from single-speaker speech, i.e., overlapped speech detection. We develop an overlap detection algorithm using an enhanced time-frequency representation, called Pyknogram, estimated directly from the input audio signal. Pyknograms use the Teager-Kaiser energy operator to detect resonant time-frequency units and thereby suppress nonharmonic structures. We show how the resulting Pyknograms provide high separability in terms of detecting the presence of interfering speech. Our proposed unsupervised Pyknogram-based detection results in over 30\% relative improvement in overlap detection error rates across different signal-to-interference ratios (SIR) compared to baseline systems. In addition, a case study is presented where we evaluate speaker verification performance under different overlap conditions using the GRID database and observe that speaker verification equal error rates (EER) vary from 2\% to 30\%, depending on the average SIR values introduced to train and test sets. In order to estimate the reliability of speaker verification scores across different trials, overlap detection results are interpreted as low-level information and stacked alongside verification outputs. The resulting high-dimensional space is passed through a support vector machine classifier to find the separating hyperplane between target and imposter scores. Combining overlap detection scores with speaker verification on average yields 20\% relative decrease in EER. We also provide an upper bound for this approach using existing overlap labels, which yields 23\% relative improvement.},

  abstract = {The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method and its variants are algorithms of choice for many Deep Learning tasks. These methods operate in a small-batch regime wherein a fraction of the training data, say \$32\$-\$512\$ data points, is sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions - and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation. We discuss several strategies to attempt to help large-batch methods eliminate this generalization gap.},

  abstract = {Speech recognition system performance degrades in noisy environments. If the acoustic models are built using features of clean utterances, the features of a noisy test utterance would be acoustically mismatched with the trained model. This gives poor likelihoods and poor recognition accuracy. Model adaptation and feature normalisation are two broad areas that address this problem. While the former often gives better performance, the latter involves estimation of lesser number of parameters, making the system feasible for practical implementations. This research focuses on the efficacies of various subspace, statistical and stereo based feature normalisation techniques. A subspace projection based method has been investigated as a standalone and adjunct technique involving reconstruction of noisy speech features from a precomputed set of clean speech building-blocks. The building blocks are learned using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) on log-Mel filter bank coefficients, which form a basis for the clean speech subspace. The work provides a detailed study on how the method can be incorporated into the extraction process of Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. Experimental results show that the new features are robust to noise, and achieve better results when combined with the existing techniques. The work also proposes a modification to the training process of SPLICE algorithm for noise robust speech recognition. It is based on feature correlations, and enables this stereo-based algorithm to improve the performance in all noise conditions, especially in unseen cases. Further, the modified framework is extended to work for non-stereo datasets where clean and noisy training utterances, but not stereo counterparts, are required. An MLLR-based computationally efficient run-time noise adaptation method in SPLICE framework has been proposed.},

Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given.

Our analysis focuses on recognition errors made both during an overlap and in the regions immediately preceding and following the location of overlapped speech. We devise an experimental paradigm to allow examination of the same foreground speech both with and without naturally occurring cross-talk. We then analyze ASR errors with respect to a number of factors, including the severity of the cross-talk and distance from the overlap region. In addition to reporting effects on ASR errors, we discover a number of interesting phenomena. First, we find that overlaps tend to occur at high-perplexity regions in the foreground talker's speech. Second, word sequences within overlaps have higher perplexity than those in nonoverlaps, if using trigrams or 4-grams, but the unigram perplexity within overlaps is considerably lower than that of nonoverlaps. An explanation for this behavior is proposed, based on the preponderance of multiple short dialog acts found in overlap regions. Third, we discover that the word error rate (WER) after overlaps is consistently lower than that before the overlap. This finding cannot be explained by the recognition process itself; rather, the foreground speaker appears to reduce perplexity shortly after being overlapped. Taken together, these observations suggest that the automatic modeling of meetings could benefit from a broader view of the relationship between speaker overlap and ASR in natural conversation},

  abstract = {A novel phoneme-lattice to phoneme-sequence matching algorithm based on dynamic programming is presented in this paper. Phoneme lattices have been shown to be a good choice to encode in a compact way alternative decoding hypotheses from a speech recognition system. These are typically used for the spoken term detection and keyword-spotting tasks, where a phoneme sequence query is matched to a reference lattice. Most current approaches suffer from a lack of flexibility whenever a match allowing phoneme insertions, deletions and substitutions is to be found. We introduce a matching approach based on dynamic programming, originally proposed for Minimum Bayes decoding on speech recognition systems. The original algorithm is extended in several ways. First, a self-trained phoneme confusion matrix for phoneme comparison is applied as phoneme penalties. Also, posterior probabilities are computed per arc, instead of likelihoods and an acoustic matching distance is combined with the edit distance at every arc. Finally, total matching scores are normalized based on the length of the optimum alignment path. The resulting algorithm is compared to a state-of-the-art phoneme-lattice-to-string matching algorithm showing relative precision improvements over 20\% relative on an isolated word retrieval task.},

  shorttitle = {Batch {{Normalization}}},
  abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

  title = {Detection and Handling of Overlapping Speech for Speaker Diarization},
  rights = {Open Access},
  url = {http://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/72431},
  abstract = {For the last several years, speaker diarization has been attracting substantial research attention as one of the spoken
language technologies applied for the improvement, or enrichment, of recording transcriptions. Recordings of meetings,
compared to other domains, exhibit an increased complexity due to the spontaneity of speech, reverberation effects, and also
due to the presence of overlapping speech.
Overlapping speech refers to situations when two or more speakers are speaking simultaneously. In meeting data, a
substantial portion of errors of the conventional speaker diarization systems can be ascribed to speaker overlaps, since usually
only one speaker label is assigned per segment. Furthermore, simultaneous speech included in training data can eventually
lead to corrupt single-speaker models and thus to a worse segmentation.
This thesis concerns the detection of overlapping speech segments and its further application for the improvement of speaker
diarization performance. We propose the use of three spatial cross-correlationbased parameters for overlap detection on
distant microphone channel data. Spatial features from different microphone pairs are fused by means of principal component
analysis, linear discriminant analysis, or by a multi-layer perceptron.
In addition, we also investigate the possibility of employing longterm prosodic information. The most suitable subset from a set
of candidate prosodic features is determined in two steps. Firstly, a ranking according to mRMR criterion is obtained, and then,
a standard hill-climbing wrapper approach is applied in order to determine the optimal number of features.
The novel spatial as well as prosodic parameters are used in combination with spectral-based features suggested previously in
the literature. In experiments conducted on AMI meeting data, we show that the newly proposed features do contribute to the
detection of overlapping speech, especially on data originating from a single recording site.
In speaker diarization, for segments including detected speaker overlap, a second speaker label is picked, and such segments
are also discarded from the model training. The proposed overlap labeling technique is integrated in Viterbi decoding, a part of
the diarization algorithm. During the system development it was discovered that it is favorable to do an independent
optimization of overlap exclusion and labeling with respect to the overlap detection system.
We report improvements over the baseline diarization system on both single- and multi-site AMI data. Preliminary experiments
with NIST RT data show DER improvement on the RT Â¿09 meeting recordings as well.
The addition of beamforming and TDOA feature stream into the baseline diarization system, which was aimed at improving the
clustering process, results in a bit higher effectiveness of the overlap labeling algorithm. A more detailed analysis on the
overlap exclusion behavior reveals big improvement contrasts between individual meeting recordings as well as between
various settings of the overlap detection operation point. However, a high performance variability across different recordings is
also typical of the baseline diarization system, without any overlap handling.},

This progress is attributed to the shift from designing features and subsequent individual sub-systems towards learning features and recognition systems end to end from nearly unprocessed data. For speaker clustering, however, it is still common to use handcrafted processing chains such as MFCC features and GMM-based models. In this paper, we use simple spectrograms as input to a CNN and study the optimal design of those networks for speaker identification and clustering. Furthermore, we elaborate on the question how to transfer a network, trained for speaker identification, to speaker clustering. We demonstrate our approach on the well known TIMIT dataset, achieving results comparable with the state of the art-without the need for handcrafted features.},

This paper proposes a noise-robust UBSS algorithm to deal with highly overlapped speech sources with residual crosstalk suppression scheme in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. The proposed algorithm is firstly to estimate the mixture matrix of noisy sources and then the original sources are recovered by suppressing the crosstalk. To reduce the noise effect on the detection of auto-source points in the STFT spectrum, we propose a method to effectively detect the auto-term locations of the sources by using the principal component analysis (PCA) on the STFTs of noisy mixtures. To mitigate the crosstalk of separated speech sources, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is implemented. Simulation results show that substantial performance improvement has been achieved.},

Accurate identification of these sections of the recording is a crucial first step for speech recognition techniques as their non-detection leads to severe degradation in performance. A possible approach to solving this problem is the use of source number estimation techniques based on the ordered profile of the spatial correlation matrix eigenvalues. In this paper we propose two approaches for detecting overlapping speech based on the Exponential Fitting Test (EFT) a source number estimation technique proposed in [1]. Firstly we propose a frequency domain implementation of the EFT, which is more appropriate when dealing with the broadband speech signals encountered in meetings. We then propose a second approach in which a correction factor is added to allow for the presence of reverberation. The performances of the proposed schemes are evaluated and compared to that of the original EFT using real meeting recordings.},

State-of-the-art techniques are based on derived features (e.g. MFCC, or Mel-filter banks), which have successfully parameterized speech spectrograms, but that reduce both resolution and detail when we are targeting other kinds of events. In this paper, we propose a method that learns hidden features directly from spectrogram patches, and integrates them within the deep neural network framework to detect and classify acoustic events. The result is a model that performs feature extraction and classification simultaneously. Experiments confirm that the proposed method outperforms deep neural networks with derived features as well as related work on the CHIL2007-AED task, showing that there is room for further improvement.},

In experiments on the augmented multi-party interaction (AMI) meeting distant-channel data, the authors show that the addition of prosodic features decreased overlap detection error. Detected overlap segments were used in speaker diarisation to recover missed speech by assigning multiple speaker labels and to increase the purity of speaker clusters. Improvements of the baseline diarisation system are reported in both single- and multi-site data conditions. However, the extension of the diarisation system with TDOAs showed its incompatibility with the overlap exclusion technique.},

  abstract = {Speaker overlap in meetings is thought to be a significant contributor to error in speaker diarization, but it is not clear if overlaps are problematic for speaker clustering and/or if errors could be addressed by assigning multiple labels in overlap regions. In this paper, we look at these issues experimentally, assuming perfect detection of overlaps, to assess the relative importance of these problems and the potential impact of overlap detection. With our best features, we find that detecting overlaps could potentially improve diarization accuracy by 15\% relative, using a simple strategy of assigning speaker labels in overlap regions according to the labels of the neighboring segments. In addition, the use of cross-correlation features with MFCC's reduces the performance gap due to overlaps, so that there is little gain from removing overlapped regions before clustering.},

  abstract = {The selection of the best features to be used in expert systems is a key issue in obtaining a satisfactory performance. Unsupervised speaker segmentation and clustering is the task of the automatic identification of the number of participants in a meeting and the determination of their speaking turns (also called âdiarizationâ). This is part of an intelligent system that replaces human intervention in several tasks related to automatic language and speech processing. The segmentation and clustering of speakers is crucial if we want to transcribe any audio recording automatically when several people take their turn. It is a task necessary to archive automatically interventions of several people in meetings, broadcast radio, lectures, parliamentary sessions etc. since a simple transcription of what is said without assigning it to a specific speaker makes the information unusable. The automation of this task would save enormous amounts of resources currently spent on human transcribers. When used online it could also be useful to point a video camera automatically to the person talking when a videoconference with multiple speakers is taking place thus replacing a human operator. Furthermore it could also help to scan large amounts of audio automatically in search of crimes or audio interventions of a particular person. In the case of recordings with several distant microphones (MDM), spatial features may and should be used. The most widely used spatial features in diarization are the Time Delay of Arrival (TDOA) features. These delays are extracted from pairs of microphones of unknown location and quality, which makes the selection of the best pairs highly advisable. This paper analyses this issue and proposes and evaluates several methods that significantly improve the performance both in speaker error rate (SER) and in computational time. The methods propose a selection ofTDOA features based on the quality of the cross-correlation of signals coming from different pairs of microphones. We prove that the use of the wrong pairs can be highly detrimental to the overall performance. The methods proposed, based on cross correlation, are compared and combined with other two selection methods, based on the dynamic range of the delay features and the selection of every pair of microphones available followed by a reduction in dimensionality. Although all algorithms achieve some improvements, it is proved that selection methods based on cross correlation have the fewest errors. The improvements on the baseline system for the two best proposed systems are 25.14\% and 33.70\% for the development set, and 55.06\% and 46.09\% for the test set. Furthermore the best method for the test set also reduces the computational cost by 20\%.},

The deep belief network pre-training algorithm is a robust and often helpful way to initialize deep neural networks generatively that can aid in optimization and reduce generalization error. We illustrate the key components of our model, describe the procedure for applying CD-DNN-HMMs to LVSR, and analyze the effects of various modeling choices on performance. Experiments on a challenging business search dataset demonstrate that CD-DNN-HMMs can significantly outperform the conventional context-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-HMMs, with an absolute sentence accuracy improvement of 5.8\% and 9.2\% (or relative error reduction of 16.0\% and 23.2\%) over the CD-GMM-HMMs trained using the minimum phone error rate (MPE) and maximum-likelihood (ML) criteria, respectively.},

For example, if each participant wears a microphone, speech from both the microphone's wearer (local speech) and from other participants (crosstalk) is received. The recorded audio can be broadly classified in four ways: local speech, crosstalk plus local speech, crosstalk alone and silence. We describe two experiments related to the automatic classification of audio into these four classes. The first experiment attempted to optimize a set of acoustic features for use with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) classifier. A large set of potential acoustic features were considered, some of which have been employed in previous studies. The best-performing features were found to be kurtosis, "fundamentalness," and cross-correlation metrics. The second experiment used these features to train an ergodic hidden Markov model classifier. Tests performed on a large corpus of recorded meetings show classification accuracies of up to 96\%, and automatic speech recognition performance close to that obtained using ground truth segmentation.},

Previous methods include enhancing the target speech, or suppressing the interfering speech or both enhancing the target and suppressing the interferer. The proposed new method searches for usable speech frames which are usually found in clusters under co-channel conditions. The term "usability" is context dependent, i.e., usable in the context of such things as speaker identification, gisting, etc. We investigate the use of kurtosis for spotting usable speech segments under co-channel conditions. Preliminary results reveal that a kurtosis of 1.5 or greater occurs close to the beginning and ends of segments of usable speech, i.e., they usually bracket the usable speech segment. For the male/male case, we observe that 92\% of usable clusters are spotted, for the male/female case 83\% of usable clusters are spotted and for the female/female case, 86\% of usable clusters are spotted},

  abstract = {Cochannel interference of speech signals is a common practical problem particularly in tactical communications. Ideally, separation of the individual speech signals is desired. However, it is known that when two equal bandwidth signals are added, such a separation is not possible. We examine the problem of identifying temporal regions or frames as being either one-speaker or two-speaker speech. This identification is important in making automatic speaker and speech recognition systems more robust and is based on feature extraction and subsequent classification as is done in pattern recognition. The research has looked into both the closed-set problem where the identity of the tow interfering speakers are known a priori and the more difficult open-set problem where the identities are not known (speaker independent). For the feature extraction step, we propose a new pitch prediction feature (PPF) which is compared with the linear Predictive cepstral coefficients (LPCC) and the mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). The features are computed and classified on a frame-by-frame basis. We compare the performance of two classifiers, namely, the neural tree network (NTN) and vector quantizer (VQ). The results show that in both the closed-and open-set cases, (1) the VQ is the better classifier and (2) the PPF outperforms both the MFCC and LPCC features. The superiority of the PFF comes with the added benefits of using a scalar feature as opposed to the 12-dimensional vectorial LPCC and MFCC features and a lower VQ codebook size.},
